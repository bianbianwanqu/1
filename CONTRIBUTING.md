# 🫡 Contributing to Suitears 💧

🙏 Thank you so much for your help in improving the project and pushing Suitears 💧r's long-term success! Many folks will be grateful to you. We are so glad to have you!

There are many ways to get involved at every level. It does not matter if you have just started with [Sui Move](https://docs.sui.io/learn/about-sui) or are the most experienced expert, we can use your help.

**No contribution is too small and all contributions are highly appreciated.**

We particularly welcome support in the following areas:

- [Reporting issues](https://github.com/interest-protocol/suitears/issues/new).
- Fixing and responding to [existing issues](https://github.com/interest-protocol/suitears/issues).
- Implementing changes and/or new features.
- Improving documentation and fixing typos.

> If you are writing a new feature and/or a breaking change, please ensure that you include appropriate test cases.

## 📜 Design Rules

Please follow the recommended [design rules](https://docs.sui.io/concepts/sui-move-concepts/conventions).

## 🙋‍♀️ Opening an Issue

If you encounter a bug or want to suggest a feature, you are welcome to [open an issue](https://github.com/interest-protocol/suitears/issues/new). For serious bugs, please do **NOT** open an issue, but contact us via [telegram](https://t.me/josemvcerqueira).

Before opening an issue, please review the existing open and closed issues as well as the existing discussions and consider commenting on one of them instead.

For general types of discussion, e.g. on best practices, formatting, etc., please consider opening a [new discussion](https://github.com/interest-protocol/suitears/issues/new).

When you propose a new feature, you should provide as much detail as possible, especially on the use cases that motivate it. Features are prioritised by their potential impact on the ecosystem, so we value information that shows the impact could be high.
